# Drew's Laptop Setup

## Prerequisites

This repo is cloned to `~/dev/laptop`

(One day I will remove this dependancy, but today is not that day)

## Setup

1) Add `source ~/dev/laptop/setup.sh` at the end of your `~/.bashrc`

2) Open a new terminal to run it

3) Open iterm2 settings and set the default profile to `DrewDarkProfile`

4) In iterm2 settings => appearance => theme => select compact

4) Import `./files/DrewPrimary.bttpreset` into Better touch tool.

## Keep an eye on

1) GPG   
When configuring your gpg key, remember to add it to git   
`git config --global user.signingkey <your key>`   

## Apps to install

These are apps I install when setting up a laptop.
